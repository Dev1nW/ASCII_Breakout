Game Overview:
You will receive an ASCII representation of the game Breakout, which includes:
	•	Paddle: Represented by =======
	•	Ball: Represented by O

Instructions:
	1.	Analyze the Game State:
        •	Carefully read the ASCII board.
        •	Determine the positions of the paddle and the ball.
        •	Display the exact game state as provided.
	2.	Determine the Best Action:
        •	Think through the current situation step by step.
        •	Decide on the optimal movement to keep the paddle in line with the ball.

        •	<action> 0 </action>: NOOP (no movement)
        •	<action> 1 </action>: Move LEFT
        •	<action> 2 </action>: Move RIGHT
	4.	Output Format:

Additional Notes:
	•	Take as long as you need to fully understand the board and the positions of the paddle and ball.
	•	Use the <reasoning> section to detail your step-by-step analysis.
	•	Ensure that your final output contains both your reasoning and the action, clearly separated by the designated meta tags.
